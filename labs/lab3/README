## 1. Gprof Comparison For FIR Filter Jetson
| Opt Level| Pynq n  | Pynq o  | Pynq s  | Jetson n  | Jetson o  | Jetson s  |
| -------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| O0       | 0.00 ms | 0.00 ms | 0.00 ms | 0.05 ms   | 0.02 ms   | 0.04 ms   |
| O1       | 0.00 ms | 0.00 ms | 0.00 ms | 0.02 ms   | 0.00 ms   | 0.01 ms   |
| O2       | 0.00 ms | 0.00 ms | 0.00 ms | 0.02 ms   | 0.00 ms   | 0.01 ms   |

| Ofast    | 0.00 ms | 0.00 ms | 0.00 ms | 0.01 ms   | 0.01 ms   | 0.00 ms   |

## 2 & 3. Time Comparison For FIR Filter on PYNQ vs Jetson (o0)
| Time     | Pynq    | Pynq pg | Jetson    | Jetson pg |
| -------- | ------- | ------- | --------- | --------- |
| real     | 1.732 s | 1.729 s | 0.266 s   | 0.263 s   |
| usr      | 1.690 s | 1.708 s | 0.252 s   | 0.252 s   |
| sys      | 0.040 s | 0.020 s | 0.120 s   | 0.008 s   |

Compiling with and without the -pq flag made a slight difference in the execution time, but not a significant one. What made a bigger differnce was which cpu the program was run on. As seen in the above table the processor on the PYNQ board is quite a bit slower than the one on the Jetson TX2.
