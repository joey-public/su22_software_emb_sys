# UCSD WES 237B Summer 2022 

This is a repository that holds all the assignments I completed for the WES237B course. The course title is software for embedded systems, and all work was completed in the Summer quarter of 2022. Each assignment folder contains a README.md that explains what the assignment was about and how to run the assignments code.
